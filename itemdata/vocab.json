The combination of these words, \"this before\" if you will, can mean a few different things. If we're talking about when something happened, the \"before\" meaning kicks in, and it means <vocabulary>the other day</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>recently</vocabulary>.

Then the second part, <ja>上がる</ja> means \"to rise.\" So, think about it this way: once you're able to do something, you rise because you're finished.

In the case of this word, we're going with the \"bend\" version. The verb of that is <vocabulary>to bend</vocabulary>. This is when you're doing the bending.

This word means <vocabulary>to be mixed</vocabulary>. This is when something is mixed but it's not mixed by you. It's just being mixed. Think of it this way - the <ja>じ</ja> in <ja>交じる</ja> is Jesus, who just uses Jesus magic to mix something. So, you're not mixing it.

This word means <vocabulary>to intersect</vocabulary>, which is kind of like mixing. When two things intersect with each other, they're getting mixed up, so that's where this word gets its meaning. \r\n\r\nTo remember that this one means \"to intersect,\" remember the <ja>わ</ja> as <reading>wa</reading>lk.

You can simply say <vocabulary>to turn something</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to rotate something</vocabulary> when answering this question, but be sure to think of yourself actually turning/rotating something. Remember this by using the <ja>す</ja> on the end. You've taken your friend <reading>Sue</reading> and put her on a stick. You're rotating her over a fire on a spit because you're a sick cannibal."

It's a set phrase people say to other people who are doing dangerous things. It's kind of like saying \"Attach energy to what you're doing!
