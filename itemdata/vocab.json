How do you tell this word apart from <ja>女王</ja>, which means  \"queen? \" Well, the <ja>女</ja> part comes before the <ja>王</ja> when it's a queen, because the queen always comes before the princess (they're usually pretty selfish in the stories, right?). As for the princess, the <ja>女</ja> comes after the king, because she doesn't have as much power. That's why this one is <vocabulary>princess</vocabulary>.","id":2555},{"char":"出す","level":5,"meaning":"To Take Out, To Hand Out, To Remove, To Turn In, To Put Out","mnemonic":"This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached.

The word means <vocabulary>to take out</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to hand out</vocabulary>, so it's like you're doing the action of causing something else to exit (rather than exiting yourself).

In this case it is <vocabulary>to give birth</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to produce</vocabulary>.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou'll have to differentiate this one from the word <ja>生まれる</ja> as well. You can remember that this one means  \"to give birth \" because when you compare, the act of giving birth probably feels shorter than the act of being birthed, at least in terms of sheer terror. The pain of giving birth will make it feel quick, when you look back on it... but just imagine how traumatized the baby must be from going through that as well. So, the act of giving birth is shorter, just like the word itself!","id":2577},{"char":"生きる","level":4,"meaning":"To Live, To Be Alive, To Exist","mnemonic":"This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached.

You want that to be as close as possible to life as you can, so you eat it when it's fresh and raw. This word can also be used to describe a <vocabulary>live</vocabulary> event, like a concert or sporting event. \\r\\n\\r\\nYou'll see this word at the beginning of other words.

It also can mean <vocabulary>to make something</vocabulary>, both in a physical sense, like making a sound, and a mental sense, like making a plan. \\r\\n\\r\\nDon't confuse this with <ja>立つ</ja>. <ja>立てる</ja> means that you're standing something up. As in,  \"I stood up the action figure \" or  \"I will erect the flag. \" You're doing the action to something else.","id":2587},{"char":"一万","level":3,"meaning":"Ten Thousand","mnemonic":"When you have <kanji>one</kanji> <kanji>ten thousand</kanji> you just have <vocabulary>ten thousand</vocabulary>.

So, a more literal meaning for this is <vocabulary>to be understandable</vocabulary>. In other words, there's no object, and <ja>分かる</ja> is intransitive, meaning it happens on its own. The <ja>かる</ja> ending is a hint, because verbs with <ja>かる</ja> as okurigana (kana added to the kanji) are usually intransitive.","id":2598},{"char":"分ける","level":5,"meaning":"To Separate Something, To Divide Something, To Share Something, To Split Something","mnemonic":"This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached.

Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is an intransitive verb. That means it does not take a direct object.

The kanji meaning for <kanji><ja>少</ja></kanji> is <kanji>few</kanji>, and the meaning of the vocab form is <vocabulary>a little</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>a few</vocabulary>.","id":2607},{"char":"少ない","level":3,"meaning":"Few, Scarce, Not Much, Not Many","mnemonic":"This word has a single kanji with hiragana attached, ending in a <ja>い</ja>.

It's <vocabulary>new</vocabulary>.","id":3472},{"char":"高校生","level":9,"meaning":"High School Student, High Schooler","mnemonic":"You know <ja>高校</ja> means  \"high school. \" So, a  \"life \" that does high school is a <vocabulary>high school student</vocabulary>.

So, this word probably has something to do with attaching. This is the intransitive version, though, where something is attached (and you're not doing the attaching). You can use the <ja>く</ja> as a hint. You see something attached on the wall. You say  \"Coo' \"","id":3475},{"char":"見付ける","level":9,"meaning":"To Find, To Find Something","mnemonic":"You know that <ja>付ける</ja> means  \"to attach \" and that <ja>見</ja> means  \"see. \" So, when you attach your seeing to something, it's like you're looking around trying <vocabulary>to find</vocabulary> something.

You also know that this is an adjective because it ends with <ja>い</ja>. You know that <ja>弱い</ja> is weak, so it probably isn't that. Instead, this one is <vocabulary>weak looking</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>frail</vocabulary>. If you know the grammar <ja>らしい</ja> you can kind of use that as a hint. The <ja>しい</ja> on the end reminds me of <ja>らしい</ja> which is like  \"seems to be. \" So,  \"seems to be weak \" =  \"weak looking. \"","id":3478},{"char":"欠ける","level":9,"meaning":"To Be Lacking, To Not Be Present, To Get Chipped","mnemonic":"This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached.

It can mean <vocabulary>to be lacking</vocabulary>, like  \"imagination is really lacking in this movie. \" It can also mean <vocabulary>to not be present</vocabulary>, like when you realize your Japanese teacher is missing. When talking about something like a tea cup or your teeth, it can mean <vocabulary>to get chipped</vocabulary>. I guess if you chip a teapot it is lacking in...perfection?","id":3479},{"char":"目医者","level":10,"meaning":"Eye Doctor, Oculist, Ophthalmologist","mnemonic":"Do you remember <ja>医者</ja> (doctor)?

This word is related to that. It's like <ja>大きい</ja> versus <ja>大きさ</ja>, where one describes the other. In this case, the <ja>高さ</ja> is the <vocabulary>height</vocabulary> of something (while <ja>高い</ja> is tall). This word isn't  \"price \" though.

They mean  \"to face \" and  \"to turn toward. \" This has a similar idea. When you add <ja>向け</ja> to something imagine you're turning it, aiming it at someone. It's aimed at them, meaning it's <vocabulary>made for</vocabulary> them. Turn a book toward someone, now it's <vocabulary>aimed at</vocabulary> them, it's made for them. See the connection?","id":3485},{"char":"研究所","level":10,"meaning":"Research Institute, Research Laboratory, Research Establishment, Research Lab, Research Facility","mnemonic":"You've seen that <ja>研究</ja> is research from previous vocab.

This is when someone is being helped, and we're focussing on the person being helped, rather than the person doing the helping. In grammatical terms, this verb is intransitive, so there is no object. The <ja>かる</ja> ending is a hint, because verbs with <ja>かる</ja> as okurigana (kana added to the kanji) are usually intransitive.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt also can be used to talk about how you were rescued, which is like being helped, right? If you want to memorize it that way, that's fine too.","id":3488},{"char":"間に合う","level":14,"meaning":"To Be In Time For, To Make It On Time, To Be On Time For","mnemonic":"There is an <kanji>interval</kanji> (of time) that you need  \"to suit \" (<ja>合う</ja>).

This word, on the other hand, is the version where something just returns (and you're not doing the action of returning). Use the <ja>る</ja> to help you to remember this. <ja>る</ja> the Kangaroo is returned to you. You don't do any of the returning, it just happens or someone else does it.

Think of it this way, when a flashlight turns on, it points a beam, of light.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou already learned <ja>点ける</ja>, which is for when you turn something on. <ja>点く</ja>, on the other hand, is an intransitive verb.
